# Enumy

Enumy is a Linux post exploitation vulnerability scanner that aims to automate as much of the intial post exploitation recon during a CTF or a pentest. Enumy has a nice interface built with ncurses if you have an SSH connection, or a standard text based interface for dumb shells. With an emphisise on portablility and speed.

## Installation

You can download the final binary from the release x86 or x64 tab. _Statically linked to musl_

- [latest release](https://github.com/luke-goddard/enumy/releases)

## Usage

Transfer the final enumy binary to the target machine

```
$ ./enumy64 -h

------------------------------------------

Enumy - Used to enumerate the target
the target environment and look for common
security vulnerabilities and hostspots

 -o <loc>     Save results to location
 -i <loc>     Ignore files in this directory (usefull for network shares)
 -w <loc>     Only walk files in this directory (usefull for devlopment)
 -t <num>     Threads (default 4)
 -f           Run full scans
 -n           Enabled ncurses
 -h           Show help
 ```

## Compilation

To compile during devlopment, make libcap and the ncurses libary is all that is required.

```shell
make
```

To remove the glibc dependency and statically link all libaries/compile with musl do the following. _Note to do this you will have to have docker installed to create the apline build environment._

```shells
./build.sh 64bit
./build.sh 32bit
./build.sh all
cd output
```

## Scans That've Been Implemented

- SUID/GUID scans
- File capabilities
- Interesting files scan
- Coredump scan
- Breakout binary scan

## Optimization

Changing the default number of threads is pretty pointless __unless__  you're running a full scan. A full scan will do a lot more IO so threads greatly increase scan times. For a full scan on my system it took the following times.

- 1 Thread -> 195 seconds
- 4 Thread -> 52 seconds
- 12 Thread -> 25 seconds
